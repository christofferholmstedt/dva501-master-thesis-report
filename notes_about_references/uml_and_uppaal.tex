\section{Analyzing the Redesign of a Distributed Lift System in UPPAAL}

A well explained case study about a lift system with a CAN bus modeled in
UPPAAL to detect some liveness and safety issues. This report might have some
valuable references but it's already 10 years old.

\section{Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design: Using UML}
A good book which gave me a crash course in UML or rather repitition on which
diagrams to use when and why. A few good examples in the book, didn't read the
case-studies.

\section{A Ravenscar-Compliant Run-Time Kernel for Safety Critical Systems}
A good walkthrough about how a "naked" Run-Time Kernel is verified with UPPAAL.
Includes a good collection of references on Model-checking with automatons.

\section{Model Checking Applied to Embedded Software of University Satellite}

A good report with the basis in a master thesis about how to properly do
model-checking and why. This reports checks that the design of the system
works as intended and no deadlocks can occur. With the help of model-checking
some problems with the requirements specification were dedicted and fixed.
