\section{Analyzing the Redesign of a Distributed Lift System in UPPAAL}

A well explained case study about a lift system with a CAN bus modeled in
UPPAAL to detect some liveness and safety issues. This report might have some
valuable references but it's already 10 years old.

\section{Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design: Using UML}
A good book which gave me a crash course in UML or rather repitition on which
diagrams to use when and why. A few good examples in the book, didn't read the
case-studies.

\section{Model Checking Applied to Embedded Software of University Satellite}

A good report with the basis in a master thesis about how to properly do
model-checking and why. This reports checks that the design of the system
works as intended and no deadlocks can occur. With the help of model-checking
some problems with the requirements specification were dedicted and fixed.

% UPPAAL in a nutshell

\section{UPPAAL in a nutshell}
This report goes through the basics of UPPAAL on how to use it. It was written
while version 2.02 was the latest and now 4.X is available. Details are
therefore different when it comes to GUI and how to do different things within
UPPAAL but the main concepts remain the same.

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the abstract some terms are used that define the basics of UPPAAL.
        With UPPAAL one constructs a model, validate it with simulation and
        verify it with model-checking.

\section{Modeling a Spacewire architecture using timed automata to compute
worst-case end-to-end delays}
Some ideas I got when reading this paper was that some upper bound can perhaps
be verified when it comes to some time property. Also the model should check
for starvation of any of the queues as well as worst case time of any queue.
