\section{Space plug-and-play Architecture}
The Air Force Resarch Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicle Directorate started a
project referred to as "Space plug-and-play Avionics" in 2004 with the intent
to understand why space systems used in various mission became so complex and
how they can be made easier to assembly \cite{fronterhouse2007, martin2012}.
The solution was to look at plug-and-play systems already available on ground.
An example to this is how USB devices work with laptop and desktop computers in
everyday life. It doesn't matter which keyboard you buy the basic functionality
will work in any computer you plug it into, no matter if it runs Windows, OS X
or a Linux distribution.

"Space plug-and-play Avionics" was released during the 2000-decade as a set of
standards and in an updated version in 2011 renamed to "Space plug-and-play
Architecture" \cite{martin2012}, all standards are available from AIAA
\cite{spa:all}.

\nomenclature{\textbf{AFRL}}{\textbf{Air Force Resarch Laboratory}}

Development and testing of implementations conforming to the standards have
been ongoing since the launch of the program. One project that has been
presented is the PnPSat by Fronterhouse et. al. \cite{fronterhouse2007} and
Martin et. al. \cite{martin2008}. They have demonstrated the first created
plug-and-play satellite and given their view on the problems encountered during
development of both hardware and software. The first plug-and-play satellite
flown on orbit is presented by Martin et. al. \cite{martin2012} where most
parts of the plug-and-play experiement passed all tests one year after launch.

As a critical part of plug-and-play satellite research and development is the
"System Data Model" (SDM) middleware software presented by Sundberg et. al.
\cite{sundberg2006}, previously under the name "Satellite Data Model"
\cite{spa:sdm-source}. The SDM can be viewed in two different ways, as a
middleware or as a "sideware" \cite{fronterhouse2007}, depending on how you
view it. The SDM is one implementation of the SPA standards that manage the
parts of handing out logical addresses to all SPA components, doing network and
data capabilities discovery. The SDM source code has been released under public
domain license \cite{spa:sdm-source}.

\nomenclature{\textbf{SDM}}{\textbf{System Data Model}}

To enable components to be self-describing all SPA components must have a xTEDS
file stored within the component. The xTEDS file include all the information
other components need to understand its capabilities e.g. which interfaces the
component have. The problem at this point arise that multiple vendors start to
create their own interface definitions and all benefits with self-describing
components are lost. This is where the "Common Data Dictionary" (CDD) comes
into play.

\nomenclature{\textbf{CDD}}{\textbf{Common Data Dictionary}}

The first work to create the CDD is described as an informal approach by Pasko
\cite{pasko2011}, instead a more formal approach using RDF is suggested. Pasko
suggests that RDF and RDF Schemas can be used to not only desribe the CDD
formally but also be used to visually represent the CDD with suitable software.

Hansen et. al.  \cite{hansen2012} describes the dictionary as an ontology which
consists of several taxonomies in a hierarchial structure. This means that if
different vendors respectively create a SPA component with a temperature sensor
and a pressure sensor interface the vendors use the CDD to describe the
interfaces with the correct vocabulary. To manage the risk of adding too
many terms in the CDD Lanza et. al. \cite{lanza2010} suggests the forming of a
CDD panel to "[...] serve as a regulatory structure for the CDD". To make it
easier for developers to write xTEDS files with the correct vocabulary and
improve the CDD, Lanza et. al.  \cite{lanza2010} have created a web based tool
to manage the CDD.

One benefit of using XML file structure for the xTEDS is that a XML schema
definition (XSD) can be created and with the help of a XML validating parser
xTEDS can be verified automatically to conform to the xTEDS file format and the
CDD \cite{lanza2010}.

\section{UPPAAL}
To verify a system meets safety-critical standards different approaches can
be taken and depending on the severity of failures that can be caused by the
system different approaches must be taken. To verify that the core SPA system
implementation presented in this paper meets some basic requirements it will be
modeled and verified with the model-checking tool UPPAAL.

On the official website UPPAAL is described as follows, "UPPAAL is an
integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of
real-time systems modeled as networks of timed automata, extended with data
types (bounded integers, arrays, etc.)." \cite{web:uppaal}. It is maintained
and developed by participants mainly from Uppsala University in Sweden and
Aalborg University in Denmark.

The formal methods behind UPPAAL builds on the research originally presented
by Alur et al. \cite{alur1994} where real-time systems are shown to be modeled
with timed finite automata. The key part is that the system has a finite amount
of states so it's possible to model it in a network of automata. Since the
presentation of the formal method, tools have been developed to make the method
useful. UPPAAL has over the last decade been forked to more specific versions
such as "TIMES" which can be used for scheduability analysis and "TRON" for
online real-time testing, other forks exist and for a more detailed history of
the development process "Developing UPPAAL over 15 years" by Behrmann et al.
\cite{behrmann2011} is suggested. In this thesis "classic" UPPAAL is used to
verify real-time properties of the system.

UPPAAL is used mainly to verify real-time systems in a wide variety of research
fields. From the field of radiation therapy \cite{man2011} and safety-critical
systems in the nuclear engineering domain \cite{lahtinen2012} to embedded
system in a university satelite \cite{alencar2013} and flight-program in an
unmanned helicopter \cite{lee2011}. Worth noting is that UPPAAL can also be used
to verify protocols such as in a distributed lift system with a CAN Bus
presented by Pang et el. \cite{pang2003} and the spacewire architecture
presented by Ermont et al. \cite{ermont2013}.

TODO: Start with model checking in general, introduce the concept of timed
finite automata and give examples on how it has been used by others.

TODO: Some notes about UPPAAL and the different forks available.
