\section{Literature study}
The literature study was conducted by selecting different key terms related to
the topics and searching for them in two different search engines. The first
one was Google scholar and the second one was the "Discovery" search engine
available for MÃ¤lardalen University's students and employees. The Discovery
search engine search through multiple databases such as IEEE Xplore,
ACM Digital Library and SpringerLink. For searches in the Discovery search
engine only articles with full text available was requested.

In Google scholar the first 20 results were looked into and the first 40
results given by Discovery search engine was looked into. Only results with
full text PDFs were selected from Google Scholar.

A first read through of abstracts was conducted to filter out unrelated
papers and then followed by a read through of introductions and conclusions for
another filtering round. The key terms selected are shown below under
respective topic's section.

\subsection{Space plug-and-play Architecture}
The key terms chosen was "Space plug-and-play Avionics", "Space
plug-and-play Architecture" and "why Space plug-and-play Avionics".

All references from two relatively new reports were looked into as well.

% space plug-and-pay avionics
%AFRL plug and play spacecraft avionics.
%developing an ontology.

\subsection{Dependability and Ada}
TODO: Move this section to another part of the report.
\subsection{Model Checking and UPPAAL}
\subsection{Internet of Things}

\section{An Agile Unified Process}
\subsection{Requirements Analysis}
TODO: Write down how I did the requirements analysis and which references I
used for guidance.

\subsection{Design with UML}
TODO: Write down how I did the design and which references I used for guidance.

\subsection{Modeling, validation and verification with UPPAAL}
TODO: Write down how I did the modeling, validation and verification and which
references I used for guidance.

\subsection{Development in Ada}
TODO: Write about the development in Ada and how regression testing was done.
Test-Driven Development was used and so on.

\subsection{An iterative process}
TODO: Mention that the requirements analysis to development in Ada (sections
above) was iterated twice to improve the end result.
