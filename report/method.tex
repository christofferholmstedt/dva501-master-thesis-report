\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}
This chapter describes the method used throughout the thesis work. First
the literature study and then the method used for designing, modeling and
implementation.

\section{Literature study}
The literature study for Space plug-and-play Architecture and the Model
Checking was conducted by selecting different key terms related to the topics
and searching for them in two different search engines. The first one was
Google scholar and the second one was the "Discovery" search engine available
for M\"{a}lardalen University's students and employees. The Discovery search engine
search through multiple databases such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and
SpringerLink. For searches in the Discovery search engine only articles with
full text available was requested.

In Google scholar the first 20 results were looked into and the first 40
results given by Discovery search engine was looked into. Only results with
full text PDFs were selected from Google Scholar.

A first read through of abstracts was conducted to filter out unrelated
papers and then followed by a read through of introductions and conclusions for
another filtering round. The key terms selected are shown below under
respective topic's section.

\subsection{Space plug-and-play Architecture}
The key terms chosen were "Space plug-and-play Avionics", "Space
plug-and-play Architecture" and "why Space plug-and-play Avionics".

\subsection{Model Checking and UPPAAL}
The key terms chosen were "UPPAAL", "UPPAAL Modeling" and "UPPAAL Modeling
Ravenscar".

\subsection{Internet of Things}
"Internet of Things" is a broad field for research and development. In
this thesis work a proof of concept with the SPA implementation is
presented within the area of Internet of Things. As this is only for the proof
of concept no specific key terms were selected instead previously known
protocols were selected for short a presentation in section
\ref{sec:sota:internet_of_things}.

\section{An Agile Unified Process}
For the development process inspiration was taken from the Agile Unified
Process presented by Larman in "Applying UML and Patterns" \cite{larman2005}.
As the SPA software is a framework no user stories nor use-cases was created
instead the different SPA standards were used as a feature requirements list.

Throughout the spring regularly meetings took place to discuss design issues
with the author of a related thesis work. Major parts of the design and code
have been created in collaboration. The implementation in Ada with ravenscar
restriction in combination with the models of the system have been created in
small increments to reach their final state.
