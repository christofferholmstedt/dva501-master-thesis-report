\chapter{UPPAAL Models}\label{ch:uppaal_models}
This chapter includes all the UPPAAL models created during the thesis work to
verify the correctness of the implementation of the SPA core framework in Ada.

\section{The models}
Each SPA application will do the same thing receive, handle and send SPA
messages. The difference between the applications is which messages each
application understands and which messages the application will ignore.
Therefore the UPPAAL models have been created so an application model can be
instantiated with the specific message types it handles in separate automata.
Each SPA application is modelled on its own to reduce complexity. A driver
model is used to vary the amount of incoming messages.

\subsection{A template application}
TODO: What is common between all applications.

\subsection{Central Addressing Service (CAS)}
TODO: Add models for the specific messages this one handles.

\subsection{Local Subnet Manager (SM-L)}
TODO: Add models for the specific messages this one handles.

\section{Verification}
TODO: Add comments about time verification and correctness.
