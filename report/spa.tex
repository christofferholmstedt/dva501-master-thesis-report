\chapter{How Space plug-and-play Avionics works}\label{ch:spa}
This section will go through how Space plug-and-play (SPA) works in detail with
system sequence diagrams and component overviews. Throughout this
section UML 2.X will be used extensively. It's worth remembering that the
purpose of these diagrams is to show the reader how SPA works, the purpose
is not to give a complete picture to developers with all the implementation
details.

\section{Two local subnets and two ethernet subnets}
\subsection{Overview}
TODO: The subnets are connected in a straight series. One processsing node, one
ethernet subnet, one processing node and then another ethernet subnet.

\section{More advanced subnets}
\subsection{Two ethernet subnets in parallel}
TODO: Two processing nodes connected with two separate ethernet networks
between them ...only overview, no sequence diagrams.

\subsection{TODO}
TODO: Any more advanced networks that can be thought of? ...only overview, no
sequence diagrams.
