Ada Protected Objects is a viable option for inter-process communication
instead of UDP/IP in a SPA network. This thesis present the initial work
towards a SPA Local Subnet Adaptation that builds on language constructs in Ada
such as Ada Tasks and Protected Objects. The system design and implementation
is verified deadlock free with UPPAAL but shows indications of livelock
possibilities. The severity of these livelock situations is discussed in the
conclusion.
