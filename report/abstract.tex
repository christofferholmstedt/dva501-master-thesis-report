Ada Protoceted Objects is a viable option for inter-process communication
instead of UDP/IP in a SPA network. This thesis present the initial work
towards a SPA Local Subnet Adaptation that builds on language constructs in Ada
such as Ada Tasks and Protected Objects. The system design is verified deadlock
free but shows indications of livelock possibilities. The severity of these
livelock situations is discussed in the conclusion.
