\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
Presented in this thesis report is a model-checked implementation of a new
subnet local adaptation for the Space plug-and-play Architecture. Instead of
UDP/IP for IPC, Ada Protected Objects are used to share data between different
Ada tasks.

TODO: Trade off between detail in models and complexity in models. Higher
detail means higher complexity. Is the current abstraction a good trade-off?


TODO: Is both the event- and time-triggered systems verified correcly with the
models and are the models good abstractions from the real-world implementation?
Is event- or time-triggered systems best in this field?



\section{Future research and development}
TODO, discussion \#1: Is this approach worth going forward with. More input is
needed regarding future operations. The presented solution which uses Ada
Protected Object requires future updates to the software in a processing node
to replace the entire binary running. There is no possibility for dynamic
linking of modules.  If there processing node has an external "manager" that
can supervise upgrades and verify that they have been installed correctly it
may be worth it, though for other embedded systems which run alone may not have
the luxury of a supervisor and an upgrade of the entire binary may be
problematic.

TODO, discussion \#2: Security. VERY important if you aim for the IoT market,
isolated robots and satellites might be a different thing but devies connected
to the internet must be secured. Security. Proof of concept has been shown and
now security must be added as early as possible so it doesn't have to be glued
on top of a system later on e.g. in a home automation, what restricts
neighbouring systems (different apartments) to talk to each other as the link
layer often is the same within a building.

TODO, lessons learned \#3: Development practices in the field of
safety-critical systems. During the development there were a lot of discussions
back and forth which Ada programming language features we could and which we
should use. ISO guidelines and publications from AdaCore are good discussions
on the different trade-offs but no firm ruling on what is good practice and
what is bad practice, as it should. The problem is without previous experience
and non-existent open-source code available online to look at the development
process has fumbled back and forth during different discussions. These
discussions have ranged from OOP to the use of access types. The lesson learned
from this thesis work is that to bring the level of confidence in the system
up someone with experience from developing safety-critical systems in Ada
should be brought in to help out with design decisions.

% TODO: Routing through several subnets with different speeds. Maximum
% Transmission Unit and routing through the networks with the best throughput
% should be looked into.

% TODO: What should be extended with regard to VN and what could be improved with
% regard to the implementation?
% 
% TODO: To improve testing of components a IPSEC/gateway for remote location
% communication could be added. Imagine that you have a development team in USA,
% Sweden, South Africa, Japan and China. All development teams work independently
% on their own SPA components. It's the responsiblity of the team in Sweden to do
% the integration testing so instead of waiting for all others to finish their
% product and send it to Sweden (could be both hardware and software), they
% connect with a SPA IPSEC gateway to all remote locations and the remote teams
% hook up their respective component. The teams have now created a plug-and-play
% system over the internet for early integration testing. This could also be used
% for remote validation and verification, the verifier connect to a remote site
% which have the component to be verified and can thereby test remotely.
% 
% TODO: "The Implementation of a Plug-and-play Satellite Bus" writes about a
% "Mission Spacecraft Design Tool" for rapid prototyping. This sounds like a
% really cool idea. Blender or Inkscape GUI, with satellite/unmanned vehicles/IoT
% purpose. The tool could create the models used for verification and the source
% code that runs on the different processing nodes.
