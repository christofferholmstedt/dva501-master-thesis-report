\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
\section{Summary}
TODO: What does this work bring? What is new and what is good about it?

TODO: What are my conclusion(s)?

TODO: Is both the event- and time-triggered systems verified correcly with the
models and are the models good abstractions from the real-world implementation?
Is event- or time-triggered systems best in this field?

\section{Future research and development}
TODO: Security. Proof of concept has been shown and now security must be added
as early as possible so it doesn't have to be glued on top of a system later on
e.g. in a home automation, what restricts neighbouring systems (different
apartments) to talk to each other as the link layer often is the same within a
building.

TODO: What should be extended with regard to VN and what could be improved with
regard to the implementation?

\section{All references}
TODO: Remove this section from your own report when it's done so only the
references you use are actually added to the bibliography \cite{*}.
