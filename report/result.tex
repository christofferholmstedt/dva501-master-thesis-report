\chapter{Result}\label{ch:result}
\section{Model simulation and verification}
TODO: Write down the result from the simulation and verication process in the
different development iterations. What did I improve between the iterations and
why?

\section{Time-triggred and event-triggered systems}
TODO: Write down the different results I found (the properties/attributes to be
measured must be defined in the problem statement).

\section{Implementation}
The implemented SPA framework code called "Virtual Network Library" is
available on Github at \url{https://github.com/virtualnetwork/vn-lib}. The
modular design is shown in figure \ref{fig:appendix_component_overview} and the
source code compiles with the Ravenscar restrictions. Efforts has also been
made to limit the amount of dynamic memory usage.

Example implementation is available in the "examples" directory in the git
repository.
