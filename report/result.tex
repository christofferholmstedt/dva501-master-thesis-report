\section{Model verification}
The model presented in chapter \ref{ch:designing_and_modeling} was verified
with the verification queries presented in the same chapter.

\begin{itemize}
    \item For deadlock verification the property was satisfied.
    \item For livelock verification the property was not satisfied.
\end{itemize}

% \section{Time-triggred and event-triggered systems}
% TODO: Write down the different results I found (the properties/attributes to be
% measured must be defined in the problem statement).

\section{Implementation}
The implemented SPA framework code called "Virtual Network Library" is
available on Github at \url{https://github.com/virtualnetwork/vn-lib}. The
modular design is shown in figure \ref{fig:appendix_component_overview} and the
source code compiles with the Ravenscar restrictions. Efforts has also been
made to limit the amount of dynamic memory usage.

Example implementation is available in the "examples" directory in the git
repository.
