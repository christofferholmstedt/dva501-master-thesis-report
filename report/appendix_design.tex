\chapter{System Design}\label{ch:appendix_design}
This appendix show the overall design of the system in UML layer, class and
sequence diagrams.

\section{Component and Service discovery process}\label{sec:discovery_process}
The following sequence diagrams show the basic component and service discovery
process for a local subnet using UDP/IP for inter-process communication
described in SPA Local Subnet Adaptation Draft \cite{spa:local-subnet}.

Figure
\ref{fig:appendix_vn_discovery_overview} starts with the high-level view of a
complete SPA network. Figure
\ref{fig:appendix_vn_local_subnet_network_discovery} continues with the
specifics of a SPA Local Subnet. Figure
\ref{fig:appendix_vn_address_block_assignment} shows the specifics on how a SPA
Subnet Manager aquires an address block from the CAS and after that the SPA
Subnet Manager assigns a logical address to each component it is aware of in
figure \ref{fig:appendix_vn_local_subnet_address_assignment}. The last step is the
component capabilities discovery process where the LS collects
information about all known components on the network, this is shown in figure
\ref{fig:appendix_vn_component_capabilities_discovery}.
